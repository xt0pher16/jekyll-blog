This file is in the **Posts** folder in your office suite, but in the **_posts** directory in Github. Look at the file conversion rules in your Cloudstitch project to see how we did that.

Youâ€™ll also notice that there is more frontmatter in the Github version of this document than specified in this document! That is also configured in our conversion pipeline: we add the date, set the file name, and set the layout for all posts in the **Posts** directory.
